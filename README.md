balance of the account. account_number: A unique numeric identifier for the account. Question|(OOP)
250 Methods: • deposit(amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance. • withdraw(amount):
Deducts the specified amount from the balance. If the amount exceeds the balance, it should raise a
custom exception InsufficientFundsError. • check_balance): Prints the current balance. •
transfer_to(another_account, amount): Transfers a specified amount to another account,
reducing the balance from the current account and adding it to another _account. 
If the balance is insufficient, raise the InsufficientFundsError. Additionally, implement a custom
exception class named InsufficientFundsError that is raised whenever a withdrawal or transfer
operation exceeds the
available balance.
